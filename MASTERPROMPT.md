ROLE & GOAL

You are an elite conversion-focused web designer and front-end architect specializing in luxury DTC brands.
Your task is to design a high-converting, premium coffee brand website worth $10,000, using GSAP-powered animations that enhance persuasion, not distract.

Target audience:

Urban professionals

Founders, creatives, high-performers

People who associate coffee with identity, discipline, and status

Primary goal:
➡️ Convert visitors into buyers
Secondary goal:
➡️ Position the brand as premium, obsessive, elite

🧠 CORE STRUCTURE — PAGES FRAMEWORK

The site must strictly follow this flow:

PLAN – Instantly clarify what this brand is and why it exists

ANCHOR – Lock attention emotionally and visually

GUIDER – Educate, build trust, remove objections

ELEVATE – Show transformation, lifestyle, superiority

SHIP – Force decisive action (purchase)

🎨 BRAND & VISUAL ID (DECIDE EVERYTHING)
Color Palette (Luxury + Warm Authority)

Primary: Espresso Black #0E0E0E

Secondary: Roasted Coffee Brown #4A2C1D

Accent: Cream Latte #F5EFE6

Highlight CTA: Burnt Gold #C89B3C

Error/Contrast Accent: Deep Oxide Red #8B2F2F

⚠️ No random colors. No gradients unless subtle and intentional.

Typography

Headings: Playfair Display / Canela / Cormorant (luxury, confidence)

Body: Inter / SF Pro / Neue Haas Grotesk

Font scale must feel editorial, not SaaS.

Grid System

Desktop: 12-column grid

Max width: 1200–1280px

Generous white space

Strict vertical rhythm

No clutter. Minimal but dominant.

🎬 ANIMATION PHILOSOPHY (GSAP RULES)

Animations must:

Be slow, deliberate, confident

Never bounce or over-ease like amateur work

Use:

ScrollTrigger

Fade + translate Y

Clip-path reveals

Image parallax (very subtle)

Every animation must support persuasion

No animation just to “look cool”.

🧩 PAGE BREAKDOWN (MANDATORY)
1️⃣ PLAN — HERO SECTION (Above the Fold)

Purpose:
Instant clarity + authority + desire

Layout:

Full viewport hero

Left: Bold headline

Right: Product image / lifestyle coffee shot

Headline Example Style (DO NOT COPY WORD FOR WORD):

“Coffee for People Who Refuse Average Mornings.”

Subheadline:

One sentence explaining what makes this coffee elite (origin, roast, obsession)

CTA:

Primary: “Shop the Roast”

Secondary (text link): “Why This Coffee Hits Different”

GSAP:

Headline word-by-word reveal

Product image slow fade + scale-in

CTA delayed entrance (authority pacing)

2️⃣ ANCHOR — BRAND STORY / EMOTIONAL LOCK

Purpose:
Make them feel something and stay.

Content:

Short brand philosophy

Why this coffee exists

Obsession with sourcing, roasting, discipline

Layout:

Split section

Dark background

Strong contrast text

GSAP:

Text lines reveal on scroll

Background image parallax

3️⃣ GUIDER — EDUCATION + TRUST

Purpose:
Remove doubt. Build credibility.

Sections inside:

Bean origin (map or minimal illustration)

Roast process (3 steps)

Taste profile

What makes it different from supermarket trash

Add:

Icons (minimal)

Real stats (roast time, altitude, grind precision)

GSAP:

Step-by-step stagger animations

Icons scale subtly into view

4️⃣ ELEVATE — TRANSFORMATION & STATUS

Purpose:
Show who they become after buying.

Content:

Lifestyle imagery (morning ritual, workspace, gym bag coffee)

Testimonials (short, masculine, confident)

Social proof (numbers, reviews)

Layout:

Horizontal scroll section OR stacked editorial layout

GSAP:

Horizontal scroll with ScrollTrigger

Image reveals with clip-path

5️⃣ SHIP — CONVERSION SECTION

Purpose:
No hesitation. Buy now.

Content:

Product card(s)

Clear pricing

Benefits bullets (not features)

Shipping + guarantee

CTA BUTTON:

“Order My Coffee”

Sticky CTA on scroll (desktop & mobile)

GSAP:

CTA pulse on idle

Add-to-cart micro animation

📱 MOBILE EXPERIENCE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Thumb-first CTAs

No heavy animations

Faster easing

Sticky bottom buy button

🧪 CONVERSION PSYCHOLOGY RULES

One primary CTA per section

No distractions

Scarcity language (limited roast, small batch)

Authority tone, not friendly blogger tone

❌ WHAT TO AVOID (OR IT’S TRASH)

Over-animated nonsense

Random fonts

Cute coffee illustrations

Weak copy

Generic Shopify layout

🧠 FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT

Generate:

Full page layout

Section-by-section structure

Color usage per section

Animation intent per section

Premium, ruthless, conversion-focused tone
